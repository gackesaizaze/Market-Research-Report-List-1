<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Photoresists</li><li>Positive Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semiconductor photoresists market is primarily divided into two types: negative photoresists and positive photoresists. Negative photoresists become insoluble where exposed to light, allowing unexposed areas to be washed away during development, suitable for specific patterning applications. Conversely, positive photoresists dissolve in the exposed regions, enabling precise designs by preserving the unexposed areas. Each type serves distinct roles in semiconductor manufacturing, impacting the resolution, production speed, and overall quality of microelectronic devices.</p></p>
