<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Facade Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventilated Facade Systems</li><li>Non-Ventilated Facade Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Facade systems are classified into two primary market types: ventilated and non-ventilated systems. Ventilated facade systems incorporate an air gap that promotes natural ventilation and thermal efficiency, helping to regulate indoor temperatures and reduce moisture buildup. In contrast, non-ventilated facade systems lack this air gap, providing a more straightforward construction but potentially leading to higher thermal loads. Both types serve to enhance building aesthetics and energy performance, catering to diverse architectural needs and climatic conditions.</p></p>
